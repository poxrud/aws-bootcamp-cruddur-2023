# Week 1 â€” App Containerization

## Remember to Commit Your Code
I committed all my code to *week1* branch and them merged it into main when all homework was completed.

## Containerize Application (Dockerfiles, Docker Compose)
I created the docker files for:
- Flask backend
- React Frontend

The dockerfiles and docker-compose can be found in my repo.

Here is evidence of the docker images running:

## Document the Notification Endpoint for the OpenAI Document
I inserted the following path into the `openapi-3.0.yml` file.

```yml
/api/activities/notifications:
    get:
      description: 'Return a feed of users that we follow'
      tags:
        - activities
      parameters: []
      responses:
        '200':
          description: Returns an array of activities
          content:
            application/json:
              schema:
                type: array
                items:
                  $ref: '#/components/schemas/Activity'
```

## Write a Flask Backend Endpoint for Notifications
I added a new service called `NotificationsActivities`, and a new notifications API path in App.py.
Here is evidence of a successful /api/activities/notifications response.

## Write a React Page for Notifications
Created a new React page component to display activity notifications.
Here is evidence of a succefull display of activity notifications.

## Run DynamoDB Local Container and ensure it works
Here is evidence of me running a query on a running DynamoDB container.

## Run Postgres Container and ensure it works

# Homework Challenges

## Run the dockerfile CMD as an external script
I created a bash script called `run_flask.sh`
with the following code inside:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
python3 -m flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=4567
```
I then gave it executable permissions and ran it:

```bash
chmod +x run_flask.sh
./run_flask.sh
```

You can see it run below:

## Push and tag a image to DockerHub
- I created a dockerhub free account.
- I build the flask docker image and then tagged it using the command:
`docker tag backend-flask poxrud/backendv1`

- I then pushed it to dockerhub with:
`docker push poxrud/backendv1:latest`

Here is a screenshot of my docker image on dockerhub:

## Implement a healthcheck in the V3 Docker compose file
Added a healthcheck to the Postgres db service. 
Made the flask backend depend on the postgres healthcheck

Healthcheck:

```yml
healthcheck:
  test: ["CMD-SHELL", "pg_isready -U postgres"]
  interval: 10s
  timeout: 5s
  retries: 5
```

here is flask-backend depending on the service:

```yml
depends_on:
  db:
    condition: service_healthy
```

## Learn how to install Docker on your localmachine and get the same containers running outside of Gitpod / Codespaces
I installed *docker-desktop* on my mac and then cloned this repo on my local
machine with `git clone https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023`

I then entered the `frontend-react-js` and ran `npm i`.

When it completed I went back to the previous directory and ran docker-compose with:
`docker-compose up`. 

Here is the screenshot of the images running successfully on my local machine:

## Launch an EC2 instance that has docker installed, and pull a container to demonstrate you can run your own docker processes.
I used the AWS Console to launch a new EC2 image based on the most current *Amazon Linux 2 AMI*. The instance launched was t2.micro so that I would stay within the free-tier.

To make things easier I launched an instance without a keypair and instead accessed
it using *EC2 Instance Connect*.

Then I installed docker based on the instructions I found here:
[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46533628/aws-ec2-ami-for-running-docker-images](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46533628/aws-ec2-ami-for-running-docker-images)

The commands were:

```bash
yum update -y
amazon-linux-extras install docker
service docker start
usermod -a -G docker ec2-user
chkconfig docker on
```
Once I had docker installed, I installed git with

```bash
sudo yum install git
```

At this point I realized that I was missing nodejs and found the instructions
on AWS's docs on how to install it.
[Install NodeJS link](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-javascript/v2/developer-guide/setting-up-node-on-ec2-instance.html)

```bash
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.3/install.sh | bash
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
nvm install 16
```

At this point I tried running `docker-compose` and realized that this also needs to be installed.

I installed it with:

```bash
pip3 install docker-compose
```

Finally,  I cloned my bootcamp repo and ran docker compose.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/
cd aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/frontend-react-js
npm i
cd ..
docker-compose up
```
This resulted in the successful running of all the docker images, as
seen in the image below.
