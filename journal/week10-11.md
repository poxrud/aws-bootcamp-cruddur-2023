# Week 10 and 11 â€” CloudFormation

## Initial Setup
To work with CloudFormation we will install helper tools: `cfn-lint`, `cfn-guard` and `cfn-toml`.

### install cfn lint
`pip install cfn-lint` 

add to `.gitpod.yml`

```yml
  - name: cfn
    before: |
      pip install cfn-link
```

 ### install cgn-guard and add the below to .gitpod

 ```sh
 cargo install cfn-guard
 ```

## Implement CFN Networking Layer

We first need to create an s3 bucket to contain artificats for CloudFormation.
We created a bucked called `cfn-mycruddur-artifacts`

```sh
aws s3 mk s3://cfn-mycruddur-artifacts
export CFN_BUCKET="cfn-mycruddur-artifacts"
gp env CFN_BUCKET="cfn-mycruddur-artifacts"
```

We use the following CloudFormation template to create a Networking Layer: [link](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/aws/cfn/networking/template.yaml)

The template creates the following resources for our networking stack:

A VPC in three AZ's with
- three public subnets
  - 10.10.0.0/24, 
  - 10.10.1.0/24,
  - 10.10.2.0/24,
- three private subnets (this will not end up being used)
  - 10.10.3.0/24
  - 10.10.4.0/24
  - 10.10.5.0/24
- An IGW for internet connectivity
- A Route Table for connectivity with the IGW

A deploy [script](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/bin/cfn/networking) was created to be able to deploy the CloudFormation template
to AWS. 

Here are the successful results of running the script:

## Implement CFN Cluster Layer

We use the following CloudFormation template to create the Cruddur Cluster Layer: [link](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/aws/cfn/cluster/template.yaml)

The template creates the following resources for our cluster cloudformation stack:
  - ECS Fargate Cluster
  - Internet facing ALB to communicate with ECS. With:
    - Security Group for ALB
    - HTTP/HTTPS Listeners for the ALB
    - Target Groups for the ALB
  - A ServiceDiscovery namespace called "cruddur-ns"

A deploy [script](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/bin/cfn/cluster) was created to be able to deploy the Cluster to AWS. 

Here is a successful deploy to CF:

Here are the ALB's HTTP/HTTPS listeners:

![CF-ALB-Listeners.png](/assets/CF-ALB-Listeners.png)

## Implement CFN Toml

_cfn-toml_ is used to store our configuration options for the CloudFormation templates.

```sh
gem install cfn-toml
```
also add it to the _CFN_ section of our `.gitpod.yml` file.

We use _.toml_ files to store configuration options. Here is an example of a toml
file that is used for Networking Stack configuration.

```sh
# aws/cfn/networking/config.toml

[deploy]
bucket = 'cfn-mycruddur-artifacts'
region = 'ca-central-1'
stack_name = 'CrdNet'
```

## Implement CFN Service Layer for Backend

We use the following CloudFormation template to create the Cruddur Service Layer for the backend: [link](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/aws/cfn/service/template.yaml)

The template creates the following resources for the backend service layer stack:

- Fargate Service
- Task Definition running docker containers for
  - 'backend-flask'
  - sidecar-nodejs (for JWT validation)
  - AWS x-ray
- IAM roles for the service and tasks

A deploy [script](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/bin/cfn/service) was created to be able to deploy the Service stack. 

Here is a successful deploy:

![CF Stack Deploy](/assets/CF-service-successful.png)

Service Stack created resources:

## Implement CFN Database Layer (RDS)

We use the following CloudFormation template to create the Cruddur Database Layer: [link](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/aws/cfn/db/template.yaml)

The template creates the following resources for our database cloudformation stack:
  - A PostgreSQL database instance with:
    - Security Group

A deploy [script](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/bin/cfn/db) was created to be able to deploy the Database layer stack to AWS. 

Here are the resources created after a successful deploy of the CF template:

![CF DB Resources](/assets/CF-db-resources.png)

The created PostgreSQL database instance:

![CF RDS Instance](/assets/CF-RDS-instance.png)

The Security Group for RDS:

## Implement DynamoDB using SAM

Instead of using CloudFormation, DynamoDB was declared using the _Serverless Application Model (SAM)_ framework. 

Here is the SAM template model that was used to create a DynamoDB table.
[link](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/ddb/template.yaml)

The template is responsible for the creation of:

- DynamoDB table
- DynamoDB stream, to trigger a Lambda for inserts
- Lambda to process insert events
- IAM Rules 
- Log groups for DynamoDB and the Lambda

NOTE: In order for SAM framework to function with the correct relative paths, it was decided
to move all DynamoDB (DDB) SAM configuration files, templates, and scripts to the project's
root `/ddb` folder. 
 
A deploy [script](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/ddb/deploy) was created to be able to deploy the SAM based DynamoDB stack.

Here is the DDB running in the AWS Console:

## Implement CI/CD

We use the following CloudFormation template to create the Cruddur CICD Pipeline: [link](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/aws/cfn/cicd/template.yaml)

The template creates the following resources for our database cloudformation stack:
  - CodeStarConnection to connect the CICD Pipeline to github
  - AWS CodePipeline with multiple steps:
    - source
      - trigger pipeline on push to `prod` on _github_
    - build
      - using `prod` build new docker images, upload to ECR
    - deploy
      - deploy newly built images to ECS Fargate cluster

Additionally, the Cloudformation template uses a _nested CF stack_ to create a _CodeBuild Project_ in order to build the updated docker images described above. 

The nested CF CodeBuild script can be found [here](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/aws/cfn/cicd/nested/codebuild.yaml).

A deploy [script](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/bin/cfn/cicd) was created to be able to deploy the CICD stack to AWS. 

Here are the resources created after a successful deploy of the CF template:

![CICD Resources](/assets/CICD-resources.png)

And here is the CodeStar connection to github.

## Implement CFN Static Website Hosting for Frontend
We use the following CloudFormation template to create the Static Website hosting using S3 buckets with CloudFront: [link](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/aws/cfn/frontend/template.yaml)

The template creates the following resources for our database cloudformation stack:
  - _Root_ and _www_ S3 buckets with corresponding permissions, and bucket policies
  - CloudFront distribution for serving static web content from the S3 buckets to the internet
  - Route53 alias record set to serve the content from the domain `mycruddur.net` and `www.mycruddur.net`

  A deploy [script](https://github.com/poxrud/aws-bootcamp-cruddur-2023/blob/b9710fccacc0c4b00bf893db2c101fe13ad3a192/bin/cfn/frontend) was created to be able to deploy the frontend stack to AWS. 

Here are the resources created after a successful deploy of the CF template:
